Exploratory Data Analysis by reducing dimensionality with Principal Component Analysis and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding

You can download the `.Rproj` and `.RData` files, load these into the Session/Workspace and save some Time on the `rtnse` calculations, as the results are then already available as objects.

Ah yeah, and you have to import the `foboga.csv` as an object yourself. Set columns `"Timestamp"` as `character` and `"Station"` as `numeric` respecitvely.
